# Campus-WIFI-Network-And-Security
To create an interconnected Wi-Fi model for all the campus areas and buildings as a whole and provide security

 TOOL USED Cisco Packet Tracer: 
 
● Router: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. 
 
● Switch: Switch allows us to set IP address on interface level. IP address assigned on interface is used to manage that particular interface. To manage entire switch, we have to assign IP address to VLAN1(Default VLAN of switch) 

● Connection: Connect all the devices with required wire. 

● End Device ( PC, Laptop, Server, Printer) A source or destination device in a networked system. For example, a user's PC is an end device, and so is a server. Network switches, routers and other equipment work in between to enable messages to travel from one end device to the other. 

● Home Gateway: To add inbuild device select home gateway device from the network devices. To authenticate and validate the wireless connection, we also can configure home gateway with WEP/WPA-PSK /WPA2 protocols 

● Web cam To capture the human motion, we use Web cam.
